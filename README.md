### If you are coming here by parachute on my profile let me explain how to do this
- create a new repo with the same name as your profile. The instructions should appear on the screen.

#### So let's go by myself: 
I'm the only developer of [Reflow](www.reflow.com.br) working full time right now. I've created it from the ground up using technologies like:
Python, Javascript, React, Next.js, React Native, Electron, Django, Celery, RabbitMQ, AWS, Django Rest Framework, Flask, Redis, Postgres, Vue.js, Jenkins and many more.

I programmed almost everything alone so i really hope you enjoy what you see.

Besides that i sometimes do some work outside of Reflow, you usually can see them here on my profile.

I also enjoy making some songs on the name of [Norcpop](https://soundcloud.com/norcpop)
