# Nicolas Leal

I'm the only developer of [Reflow](www.reflow.com.br), working full time right now. I've created it from the ground up using technologies like:
Python, Javascript, React, Next.js, React Native, Electron, Django, Celery, RabbitMQ, AWS, Django Rest Framework, Flask, Redis, Postgres, Vue.js, Jenkins and many more.

I programmed almost everything alone so i really hope you enjoy what you see.

Besides that, i sometimes do some work outside of Reflow, messing with stuff like WebGL, WebAssembly and some new technologies that emerge, you usually can see them here in my profile.

I also enjoy making some songs on the name of [Norcpop](https://soundcloud.com/norcpop)

I've started studying Information Systems in USP, but left it thinking programming was not for me (silly me). Right now i'm almost finishing my graduation in Marketing in USP also, and i couldn't be happier.
