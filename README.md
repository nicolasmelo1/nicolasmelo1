# Hello my dude or my girl, it's me, Nicolas Leal ‚ò∫Ô∏è

How are you? Good? Hope so.

Welcome to my little and private place called *my github*. I know it's a little bit messy around here. But don't worry, __i'll guide you__.

Summary:
- [A little bit about myself, how i was always curious, and that i always enjoyed building stuff](https://github.com/nicolasmelo1/nicolasmelo1/edit/master/README.md#oh-how-rude-of-me-i-didnt-even-got-to-introduce-myself-)
- [About college, education and all that](https://github.com/nicolasmelo1/nicolasmelo1/blob/master/README.md#youre-not-curious-by-my-infant-years-sorry-about-that-)
- [How i got into programming and early carreer]()

## Oh, how rude of me, i didn't even got to introduce myself ü•π

So, where do i begin?

I am Nicolas, Nico, Nick, Pipoca (nickname my father gave me while i was still a baby, it translates in english to Popcorn. It can be because of my freckels or because i never settle down, i don't really know). This ride called life has been rather fun for me. Since i started being aware of myself i know i always liked to build things. LEGO was one of my favorite toys. Yeah, sometimes i used to build the lego as it was intended to on the manual but most of the times i liked to build stuff that came right from my head. I built houses, airplanes, boats, all sorts of things. When i started growing old what changed was that i was trying to build stuff. Parents and people i know, knows me from two things: 

- Either i destroy things i touch
- Or i fix everything i touch

Luckly, i'm mostly known by the second. I was rather curious about how stuff worked, tried to fix the computer by myself, my mouse, my keyboard, my headphones. Got a new bicycle, why go to the shop when i can build myself? Sometimes it worked, sometimes i needed to accept my defeat and surrender.

Things i tried to do while discovering myself and what i really enjoyed:

## You're not curious by my infant years? Sorry about that. üòñ

It's always fun how your life tricks you and changes in ways you didn't expect, doesn't it?

Anyway, i always though engineering was my thing, but for some reason i got into a bachelors degree in Information Systems as University of S√£o Paulo, the best university in Latin America. The funny thing about that is that i spent 4 years in this graduation and during all of those years i spent most of my time thinking that it was not for me. 

- "What is a Linked List?" 
- "What the hell is a Tree? Why is it called a tree if the root is up and not at the bottom?" 
- "When will i use this in my life?" 
- "Why people seems to be so more far ahead than me?" 
- "I need to study for exams and i also need to study outside what college already asks for me in order to find a job? Why doesn't college teach me this new framework to find a job?"

Silly me, in all ways. After 4 years i started a graduation in Marketing, same university. When i started my graduation i knew that i needed a job. What job i got? A job in 99 (that was later acquired by DIDI), the first unicorn in Brazil, in an area called Marketing Analytics.


## Now we get to the fun part about my work, take a seat, eat a snack and then let's continue üìú

Are you hydrated? Do you feel comfortable? Cool.

So my job was primarely update 

I was the only developer of [Reflow](www.reflow.com.br). I've created it from the ground up using technologies like:
Python, Javascript, React, Next.js, React Native, Electron, Django, Celery, RabbitMQ, AWS, Django Rest Framework, Flask, Redis, Postgres, Vue.js, Jenkins and many more.

I programmed almost everything alone so i really hope you enjoy what you see.

Besides that, i sometimes do some work outside of Reflow, messing with stuff like WebGL, WebAssembly and some new technologies that emerge, you usually can see them here in my profile.

I also enjoy making some songs on the name of [Norcpop](https://soundcloud.com/norcpop)

I've started studying Information Systems in USP, but left it thinking programming was not for me (silly me). Right now i am a bachelor graduate of Marketing in USP, and i couldn't be happier.
